## Motivation

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a devastating loss of life but it has also devastated the nation's economy. COVID-19 has a huge direct impact on labor supply shock to each sector arising from morbidity, mortality, and lockdown, as well as the indirect impact caused by the interdependencies between sectors in the US economy. Below are some resources that dive into these topics, from foundation and company:

•	[KFF](https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/issue-brief/economic-impact-of-covid-19-on-pepfar-countries/) published an article about how COVID-19 had set back economic progress worldwide by reporting GDP.

•	[Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/economy/us-consumer-spending-after-covid.html) company release article focusing on different aspect of consumer spending during COVID-19.
